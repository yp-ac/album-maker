# Album Maker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity
Code should be simple to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Prioritize readability and maintainability over advanced features.

### II. Intuitive UI
The user interface should be intuitive enough for users to navigate and use the album maker easily without extensive training.

### III. Basic Testing
Include some basic tests to ensure core functionality works, but do not invest heavily in an extensive testing suite for this POC.

### IV. Functionality Focus
Prioritize core album-making features such as creating, editing, and organizing albums. Avoid adding non-essential advanced features.

### V. Minimal Dependencies
Use minimal external dependencies to keep the project lightweight and easy to set up.

## Technology Stack

Use simple, modern web technologies suitable for a POC. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React if needed for component management). Backend: Node.js with Express if server-side logic is required, or keep it static if possible. Database: Local storage or simple file-based if needed.

## Development Workflow

Simple workflow: Plan features in specs, implement incrementally, run basic tests, commit regularly. Code reviews for major changes. Focus on delivering working POC quickly.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes other practices. Amendments require documentation and agreement. Version increments follow semantic versioning: major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for fixes. Compliance reviews ensure adherence to principles.
